**__Decepticon Seekers Information__**
» The term Seeker refers to Decepticon jet soldiers who all share the same body style that primarily looked like Starscream, but in different colors or with minor variations in wing and head shapes.
» The Starscream/Skywarp/Thundercracker chassis is referred to as an "Energon Seeker". The most obvious alternate name for these Transformers—and the one generally used by pack-in cross-sell catalogs—is Decepticon Planes.
